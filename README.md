Our K Nearest Neighbors function can be found here: [KNN](https://github.com/Alex-Lacy/CS499-Project-2/blob/master/KFoldCV.py)

This time, our algorithm and driver code are packaged into the same file.

Our algorithm is designed to only work on single sets of binary classification data.  For our results, we used [Stanford's Spam Data](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html) for our data. 

In order to use our code effecitvely, please be sure you have the data file in the same directory as the driver function, and be sure to import it in the code.

We have a large commented section in our code.  The comented section is slighly more efficient, but uses the build-in split functionality from the library we are using.  Don't worry, though.  It returns the same results as the ready-to-use code.

That's it! Run the code and watch the algorithm work!
